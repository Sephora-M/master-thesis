\section{Deep Learning}
Deep Learning is an area of Machine Learning that is  characterized as a set of algorithms aiming at learning  representations of data.  These algorithms, known as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are inspired by biological neural networks. An ANN is typically composed of multiple layers of artificial neurons, and each of these neural units are connected with many others. A deep learning model is able to extract from the data relevant features for solving a specific task. [REFERENCE TO MORE INFO ON DL]

Several deep learning architectures such as convolutional deep neural networks, deep belief networks and recurrent neural networks have led to state-of-the-art results on numerous applications in computer vision, natural language processing, audio recognition and bioinformatics [REFERENCES]
